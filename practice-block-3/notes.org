* Tutorial: Practice Block Three

Graphs and greedy algorithms.

Use the graph implementation from the book (~m269_graphs.py~), set a few problems
to be solved using it.

You need to install the module ~networkx~ to work with this code.

1. Write a function ~disconnected~ that takes a DiGraph and returns the
   disconnected nodes.
2. Write two functions ~traverse_df~ and ~traverse~bf~ that perform 
   depth-first and a breadth-first traversal respectively. (There is a similar
   exercise in the book but it uses a different graph implementation.)
3.
